## Overview

Welcome to the Brazilian Banks Icons repository! Here, you'll find a comprehensive collection of SVG icons representing various banks and financial institutions in Brazil. We're excited to share these resources with the community to facilitate the design and development process for everyone.

## Why Brazilian Banks Icons?

When we started budgi, we encountered challenges in finding high-quality icons and logos, especially in SVG format. Initially, a Figma project called "Brazilian Banks Icons" came to our rescue, but unfortunately, it was discontinued. In the spirit of paying it forward, we've created this repository to provide a free and open resource for all.

## Features

### 1. Free Access

Now, anyone can freely access and use the SVG icons we've created for representing financial institutions. It's an open resource for everyone!

### 2. Encouraging Collaboration

We invite developers, designers, and enthusiasts to contribute, suggest improvements, and expand the collection. We believe in the power of community collaboration.

### 3. Completely Free

Our resources are available for use without any cost. We aim to make valuable assets accessible to everyone.

## Why Open Source?

We believe in transparency, the strength of collaboration, and the potential of the community to drive innovation. By opening up our resources, we hope to contribute to a more robust and accessible ecosystem.

## How to Contribute

We invite everyone to suggest, add, or update icons and submit pull requests to enhance the project's quality. Your contributions play a crucial role in making this collection even more valuable for the community.

## Getting Started

To quickly access and use the icons, visit our [Figma Project](https://www.figma.com/community/file/1327643008692498004/brazilian-banks) for rapid export.

We're thrilled to see the amazing contributions from the community and look forward to building a stronger, collaborative platform for design and development.

Happy designing! ðŸš€
